after inspection of the both inital guesses of global landmarks, where one leads to success and the other failed,  it seems the problem is still in assosiation.





After visually inspect the pose graph by comparing the resutl_g2o.g2o  and Fend.g2o on colab :

Update:  17 Nov,   it seems the one from to_compare is more correct is actaully wrong,  what we did wrong in constructing to_compare was, we used the coords from global map ( under global map aspect ) to define our edges,  while the coords of edgeSE2XY were supposed to be how those landmarks were seem/ observed by the robot at current position .ie.: the edges should be values in local map ( which we can obtain from single scan) 

To Fix it :  create a data structure along with global_map , which hold exact same values excepct in this one the x an y columns are holding the values of x y before they have been tranformed to global aspect ( like what was done in  updating global_map )
